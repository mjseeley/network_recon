# network_recon

This is an old project that I'm trying to freshen up for python3 and maybe others will get some use out of.
The original idea was that this will scan network devices, build a device object and then with additional code crawl 
the network and build a databse of network devices and their details.

This was originally built in a very homogenous Cisco network several years ago so mileage may vary outside of that.

I'm looking to get some advice and help clean things up and test things out. 
I have been testing only with the small amount of Ubiquiti gear I have, it works for the most part.
