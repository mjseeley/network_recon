# network_recon

This is an old personal project that I'm trying to freshen up for python3 and maybe others will got some use out of it.
The original idea was that this will scan network devices, build a device object and then with additional code crawl 
the network and build a databse of network devices and their details.

This was built in a very homogenous Cisco network several years ago so mileage may vary outside of that.

I'm looking to get some better coders than me to give advice and help clean things up and test things out. 
I have been testing only with the small amount of Ubiquiti gear I have, it works for the most part.

I'm a rookie at python and git so bare with me.
