# network_recon

This is an old project that maybe others will get some use out of.
The original idea was that this will scan network devices, build a device object and then with additional code crawl 
the network and build a databse of network devices and their details.

This was originally built in a very homogenous Cisco network several years ago so mileage may vary outside of that.
